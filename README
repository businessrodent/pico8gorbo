rundown of business:
  the file present in this repository is that of gorbos shop.
  this game has been written in the pico8 variation of lua.
  it utilises object oriented programming (to the best of both my and the languages capacity) as well as some more hard coded elements.
  the cart is also available on the pico8 website at https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=144507


hope you enjoy!
